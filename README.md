# odin-recipes

This is a simple project that I did for The Odin Project!

The goals of the project are as follows:
1. Create a default page that links to your 3 recipes
2. Create a page for each of your 3 recipes
3. Fill in info for each of your recipes including an image, description, ingredients, and steps!
